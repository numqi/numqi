Apparently, when the loss function is optimized to zero, we have $\\rho=\\sigma$ and $\\sigma$ is separable which means that we find a separable decomposition for $\\rho$. However, this loss function is not convex (with respect to the parameters) and there is no guarantee that the global minimum can be find. It should be noted that this optimized value is NOT entanglement measure as it could increase when we apply local operations and classical communication (LOCC) on $\\rho$ which violate the requirement of the entanglement measure.\n",

However, quantum relative entropy is not a distance function as it's asymmetrical with respect to $\\rho$ and $\\sigma$. Most importantly, it's jointly convex with respect to both $\\rho$ and $\\sigma$, so we will see some semi-definite programming (SDP) to solve some objective function in the later tutorials. However, it's not convex with respect to our parametrization $\\theta$ and we have to use non-convex optimization (gradient-based optimization) to solve it. The optimized (minimized) value is called relative entropy of entanglement (REE).\n",
